A Comic book side scrolling adventure. Scroll your way through endless randomly generated levels by jumping over the pits, shooting the road blocks, flying enemy and bullets. Gather as much score as you can to surpass the highest score. Much like the classic Atari game Moon Patrol!

* Artwork style inspired by the artist Roy Lichtenstein. His work was greatly inspired by the classic comic book strip and yet was criticized for copying the classic comic style. Roy Lichtenstein's immense  criticism that followed him his hole life was exactly what I tried to achieve here in this game, trapped in a endless comic book.
